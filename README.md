# AegisGuard

"AegisGuard" is a robust and flexible security engine for web applications and APIs, providing a wide array of features to safeguard your services. Developed in Go, "AegisGuard" acts as a protective layer, analyzing and filtering incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests to ensure that only legitimate traffic gets through.

## Key Features:
- Traffic Filtering: Detects and blocks common web-based attacks like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- Rate Limiting: Prevents Denial-of-Service (DoS) and brute-force attacks by tracking and limiting requests from individual IP addresses.
- IP Blacklisting/Whitelisting: Allows blocking or permitting requests from specific IP addresses.
- API Key Validation: Validates API keys used for authentication.
- Authentication/Authorization: Validates JWT tokens, OAuth tokens, or other authentication tokens for authenticated routes.
- Content Security Policy Enforcement: Ensures server responses adhere to a specified content security policy.
- Anomaly Detection: Learns normal request patterns and alerts when anomalous patterns occur.
- Logging and Alerting: Logs all requests and responses, providing real-time alerts for identified threats.
- Integration with Threat Intelligence Platforms: Stays updated with the latest threats and vulnerabilities.
- API Schema Validation: Validates request payloads against predefined schemas.

## Architecture:
"AegisGuard" employs a modular and microservices architecture for high scalability and reliability. It is designed to function as middleware, offering easy integration with any application regardless of the technology used in the backend. It is driven by configuration, making it highly adaptable to different application needs.
