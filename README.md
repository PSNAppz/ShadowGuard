# AegisGuard

"AegisGuard" is a robust and flexible security engine for web applications and APIs, providing a wide array of features to safeguard your services. Developed in Go, "AegisGuard" acts as a protective layer, analyzing and filtering incoming HTTP/HTTPS requests to ensure that only legitimate traffic gets through.

## Key Features:
- ![Active Mode](https://img.shields.io/badge/ACTIVE_MODE-FF0000) Traffic Filtering: Detects and blocks common web-based attacks like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- ![Active Mode](https://img.shields.io/badge/ACTIVE_MODE-FF0000) Rate Limiting: Prevents Denial-of-Service (DoS) and brute-force attacks by tracking and limiting requests from individual IP addresses.
- ![Active Mode](https://img.shields.io/badge/ACTIVE_MODE-FF0000) IP Blacklisting/Whitelisting: Allows blocking or permitting requests from specific IP addresses.
- ![Active Mode](https://img.shields.io/badge/ACTIVE_MODE-FF0000) Content Security Policy Enforcement: Ensures server responses adhere to a specified content security policy.
- ![Passive Mode](https://img.shields.io/badge/PASSIVE_MODE-8A2BE2) Anomaly Detection: Learns normal request patterns and alerts when anomalous patterns occur.
- ![Passive Mode](https://img.shields.io/badge/PASSIVE_MODE-8A2BE2) Logging and Alerting: Logs all requests and responses, providing real-time alerts for identified threats.
- ![Passive Mode](https://img.shields.io/badge/PASSIVE_MODE-8A2BE2) Integration with Threat Intelligence Platforms: Stays updated with the latest threats and vulnerabilities.
- ![Active Mode](https://img.shields.io/badge/ACTIVE_MODE-FF0000) API Schema Validation: Validates request payloads against predefined schemas.

## Modes of Operation:
"AegisGuard" can operate in two modes: Active and Passive. In ![Active Mode](https://img.shields.io/badge/ACTIVE_MODE-FF0000), it actively filters incoming requests and blocks malicious traffic. In ![Passive Mode](https://img.shields.io/badge/PASSIVE_MODE-8A2BE2), it only logs requests and responses, and alerts when it detects a threat. Active mode is recommended for APIs which are critical to the functioning of the application.

## Architecture:
"AegisGuard" employs a modular and microservices architecture for high scalability and reliability. It is designed to function as middleware, offering easy integration with any application regardless of the technology used in the backend. It is driven by configuration, making it highly adaptable to different application needs.
